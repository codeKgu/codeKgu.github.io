## About Me

Hi! I am a fresh graduate of University of California, Los Angeles where I studied Computer Science. I grew up in North Delta and graduated from the IB program at Seaquam Secondary. Over the course of my education, I realized the immense opportunities that a solid foundation in mathematics can bring and have a strong passion for teaching math. 

Personally, I have had a long history in math. In elementary school, I competed in the [ELMACON math competition](https://www.elmacon.org/), with top 10 finishes in multiple years. In highschool, I was a regional finalist for [Math Challengers](http://www.mathchallengers.ca/) and was school champion for the CEMC Waterloo [math contests](https://cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/contests.html) such as the Hypatia and Fermat (Gr. 11). 

In regards to tutoring experience, I was a Delta School District MathStretch mentor in highschool. At university I am also a tutoring chair for one of our Computer Science clubs, in which I help host midterm and final review sessions for Computer Science courses. 


I am looking for opportunities this summer to tutor eager students from grades 6 to 12 in math (including IB math) and am available anytime on the weekends. If you are interested feel free to contact me at kengu13@ucla.edu.
